1) what is the difference between Props and State? 
Ans->  props are used to configure a component from its parent, while state is used to store dynamic data that changes within the component.


2) Explain the useState API?
Ans-> The useState API is used to add state to a functional component by returning an array with two values: the current state value, and a function to update the state value.

3) Explain the how map, filter, reduce work 

map: map takes an array, applies a function to each element of the array, and returns a new array with the results. The function passed to map is called for each element in the array, and its return value is used to create the new array.


filter: filter takes an array, applies a test to each element of the array, and returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test. The test is a function that returns either true or false for each element in the array.


reduce: reduce takes an array and reduces it to a single value by applying a function to each element of the array. The function passed to reduce takes two arguments: the accumulated value and the current value. The accumulated value is updated for each element in the array, and the final accumulated value is returned.
